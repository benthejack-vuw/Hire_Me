### Hi Field
I'm really into what you're doing and would love to work with you!

My goal is to make beautiful interactive wonders for the web, for giant screens, and for little mobile screens too. I'm also really into generative and procedural art and design (I've been having fun CNC milling generative ceramics lately which you can check out on instagram: https://www.instagram.com/_benthejack_).

I have been creative coding for 11 or so years. I have around 5 years experience of C++ (Cinder, openframeworks, openCV, openGL, and writing plugins for Maya). 5 years writing Javascript, webGL & threeJS. I've also been using Unity for some big installations in Museums since 2017. I've had a healthy dose of freelance full-stack web development work (ruby on rails) and Before the demise of flash I used to do a lot of flash development. I've also done a fair bit of work with Arduino, raspberry PI, and analog electronics, a subject I've been teaching as a lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington. More recently (the last year or so) I've been dabbling in Houdini and Rhino/grasshopper - something I'm wanting to up-skill in.

Before lecturing, I worked a couple of years in a Buddhist art studio that made statues and ornaments for temples opening internationally (in Cumbria). From this I developed professional craft skills, mould-making and casting, spray painting (car body-paint systems in paint booths), construction, and finishing (I'm pretty darn good with sandpaper and filler). This is probably totally irrelevant, but also maybe not if you ever need extra hands to help build and finish an installation.

I'm moving to the UK from New Zealand in July to be with my partner (I have an ancestry visa and have worked in the UK in the past) and really hope to keep doing creative code based work.


## More about this piece
This little particle system is based on a lightweight multi-pass GLSL computing library I've built on top of threeJS (it's not much but it tidies up setting things up).
It's a new and improved webGL version of some particle work I did for an EEG controlled installation shown at FILE Brazil in 2011 & 2012 (https://vimeo.com/16329472). Back then it was done in C++ and openCL. I've re-visited, improved, and done it in WebGL this last week or so.

I hope you don't mind me borrowing and putting your logo in there, it felt a little cheeky but it looked slick.


## Building
1) clone or download repo
