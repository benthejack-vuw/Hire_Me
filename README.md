# Hi Field
I'm really into the work you're doing and would love to have the opportunity to do it with you!


## More about this piece
This little particle system is a new and improved webGL version of some particle work I did for an EEG controlled installation shown at FILE Brazil in 2011 & 2012 (https://vimeo.com/16329472). Back then it was done in C++ and openCL. I've re-visited, improved, and written it in WebGL/GLSL this last few weeks. it's built with a lightweight multi-pass GLSL computing library I'm working on (uses threeJS).
